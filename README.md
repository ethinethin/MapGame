MapGame
-

A procedurally-generated map game written in C and SDL2. I am writing this as part of my "Twitch Game Jam" (rules below), with development being streamed at: https://twitch.tv/ethinethin

Installation
-

Want to try out the game? It should compile no problem on Linux or macOS with the instructions below. It will also probably compile on Windows (and the *BSDs if you can install SDL2), but I don't know how (...yet!).

Download and install SDL2 from here: https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

Then clone, compile and run with:

    git clone https://github.com/ethinethin/MapGame
    cd MapGame
    make
    ./mapgame

Piece of cake! In-game keys are:

- ESC: quit game
- Arrow keys and WASD: move around
- M: show world map

That's all there is so far!

I am programming this as part of a challenge, with the following conditions:
