MapGame
-

A procedurally-generated map game written in C (with SDL2). The majority of development has been streamed at: https://twitch.tv/ethinethin

Installation
-

Compiling on MacOS, Linux, or *BSD is straightforward. First download and install the SDL2 libraries from here: https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

Then clone, compile and run with:

    git clone https://github.com/ethinethin/MapGame
    cd MapGame
    make
    ./mapgame

Instructions for compiling on Windows are yet to be determined.

Starting a Game
-

On the title screen, use the mouse or `[keyboard]` to access:

- `[N]` start a new game
- `[C]` load game or continue game in-progress
- `[O]` options
- `[Q]` quit

Display Options
-

Several resolutions are provided to fit most display configurations. The game can either be run in a window or fullscreen. Fullscreen â€”> Default is the recommended fullscreen option, which uses the native desktop resolution.

If your preferred, non-desktop resolution is not on the list, you can try changing the resolution in `save/opts.mg` by opening it in a text editor.
